<p>As time has evolved, more musical instruments have developed resulting in more sophisticated and complex sounds being produced. The rhythm, pitch, timbre, and lyrics of songs have all changed along with the changes in cultures over time. To help analyze these changes we will use Spotify's and Billboard's Top 100 data. Spotify is a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songs, podcasts and videos from artists all over the world.<sup>1</sup> Consequently, Billboard Top 100 is the music industry's standard record chart in the United States for songs. Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming in the United States. A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public every Tuesday.<sup>2</sup> As a result, we can determine why songs become popular by analyzing their rhythm (placement of sounds in time), pitch (the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" or "lower") and timbre (the quality of music note or sound that distinguishes different types of musical instruments, or voices) for specific years since 1980.</p>
