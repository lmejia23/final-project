Choose between the following attributes to compare years of music, defined here (definitions provided by the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-several-audio-features/). All values are determined based off of each year's respective average:

- **Popularity**: The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.

- **Danceability** : Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

- **Energy** : 	Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.

- **Loudness** : The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Values typically range between -60 and 0 dB

- **Valence** : A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positivity conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

- **Tempo** : The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.

- **Words Per Second** : The rate of words per second in the song lyrics of a particular song, with wordier songs having a higher occurrence of words per second.
