## Section 2: Billboard Data

This section focuses on data collected by Billboard, a collection of the most popular U.S songs from 1950 to 2015. 

This specific data-set was collected by Juhee Lee, Yinan Wen, and Kevin Schaich, and can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinschaich/billboard). However, the basis of that data set are the actual Billboard rankings, which can be found [here](https://www.billboard.com/charts)

``` {r find_data, echo = FALSE}
billboard <- head(get_year(1997))
