## Visualization Two:

This visualization expresses comparisons of average number of words and lyrics per minute of all songs within a year, for a set of years. A bar graph is used to communicate the differences and trends of this average number of words per minute, although a similar representation can be made using a line graph. We chose a bar graph over a line graph because the data is more discrete and not continuous, as a line may suggest; therefore, we thought a bar graph would better represent the data we sought after.

## Visualization Four:

This visualization expresses comparison of relative quality (determined by Billboard data set) of two songs in two different time periods. A column graph is utilized here to express comparisons of rhythm, pitch and timbre for the two songs. A column graph is utilized here to express comparisons easily. This visualization also provides a clearer comparison of "energy", which translates to dancibility, loudness, and tempo.
